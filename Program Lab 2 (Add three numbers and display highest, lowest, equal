// Program Lab 2 Ver 2.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.
// Program Lab 2 Ver 2 added an adding code for three numbers
// No errors fixed errors in highest number formula between b and c
// it will now display that all numbers are equal or not
//added a do while loop to let the user retry again.
